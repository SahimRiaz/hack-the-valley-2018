## Challenge

The goal of this challange is to build a machine learning model to preduct future Etherium prices.

## Submission guide lines

The goal if this challange is to build a deep learning model for prediction Etherium prices. The Input data set is already preprocessed and contains training data examples for which to fine tune thew model.

Additionally, we also supply a skelleton deep learning model that reads in the data and creates final predictions.

It is important, that we do not allow the integration of outside data, or any changes to the input/ouput part of the supplied code.

The challenge is to only change the layers of the given skelleton model to optimize the final prediction.

At the end the model with the best predictions will win.

This repo contains 3 Files:

### Model.ipnby
This file contains the skelleton model, and here participants can experiment with different types of deep learning architectures.

### train.txt
This file contains the data for training the model.


### predict.txt
This file contains the data points that needs to be predicted.
