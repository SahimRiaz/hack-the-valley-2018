# Hack The Valley ZGL Challenge 2018
## Prerequisites

We expect challenges with prior knowledge of Python, and machine learning to perform well.
## Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to build a machine learning model to predict future Etherium prices.

The Input data set is already preprocessed and contains training data examples for which to train the model.

Important: We do not allow the integration of outside data.

At the end, the model with the best predictions will win.

For evaluation we use root mean square deviation:

This repo contains 2 Files:
### train.csv

This file contains the data for training the model.
https://github.com/zerogravitylabs/hack-the-valley-2018/blob/master/train.csv

### predict.csv

This file contains the data points that need to be predicted.
https://github.com/zerogravitylabs/hack-the-valley-2018/blob/master/predict.csv

## Time limit

2 hours
## Submission
For the final submission:

The format of the final prediction is a .txt file containing the predicted daily Etherium price, line by line. For example:

400<br/>
420<br/> 
300<br/> 
800<br/>
1100<br/>

Please upload both your model, your final predictions and contact information.

To help process the submission please name the file containing your model (code):

teamname-model

and the prediction text file as:

teamname-prediction

and include your contact information in another file so we can contact you if you win!
